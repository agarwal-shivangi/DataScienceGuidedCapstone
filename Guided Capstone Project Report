Write a 1-2 page report summarizing your recommendations for Big Mountain Resort. Be sure to 
include the figures you created to back up your recommendations 

The first part of this project was Data Wrangling. In this section, the explore the data and 
identify indexing for the data set (State Region Resort). We also added state data including 
the population and the state are square miles. We dropped data that was incomplete, and decided 
the target feature to be Adult Weekend ticket price. 

The next portion of the project was exploratory data analysis. Here, we scaled the data and 
tried to use graphs to find correlations between price and other features. The features with 
the highest correlation were runs, fast quads, vertical drops, and total chairs. 

In the next portion of the project, we selected a model based off lowest MAE. The random forest 
model had the best results, and the predictions made with this model were closest to accurate. 

The next step is to make predictions by changing features. This is where our recommendations come 
in. For Big Mountain Resort, the original Adult Ticket Weekend price is 81$. Based on the analysis 
done, data shows that reducing the number of runs by one, there is no effect to the ticket price. After 
the initial step to increase the ticket price and cut down the least used run, the resort can start 
exploring long term options. Modeling further showed that adding a vertical drop of 150 feet, another run, 
and an additional ski lift, ticket prices can be increased by 1.99 to $97.85.
